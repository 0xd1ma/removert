## What is removert?
- Goal: **static map construction** in the wild. 
- The name is from the abbreviation of our title "***Remov***e-then-re***vert***" (IROS 2020): [paper](https://irap.kaist.ac.kr/publications/gskim-2020-iros.pdf), [presentation](todo)


## Why removert?
- To deal with the inherent and inevitable motion ambiguities of robot's state estimation.
  - By *multiple various resolution of range images*. 


## Static map construction examples
- TBA

## How to use? - Matlab 
- TBA

## How to use? - C++
- TBA
